# Overview
Coffee node is a simple CRUD application designed with the coffee connisuer in mind. Once registered, users can record details each time they make a cup, sort of like a lab journal. It allows for different brew methods, records the date a brew was made, and many other paramaters that help a user make the perfect cup. Under the hood, it uses mongo, express, and node.js.
